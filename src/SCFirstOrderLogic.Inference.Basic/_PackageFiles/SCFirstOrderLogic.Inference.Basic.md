Very basic first-order logic knowledge base implementations that use the models defined by the [SCFirstOrderLogic package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SCFirstOrderLogic/).
Not useful for anything resembling a production scenario, but perhaps useful as a tool for learning and experimentation.

Full documentation can be found as part of the documentation for the SCFirstOrderLogic package, [here](https://sdcondon.net/SCFirstOrderLogic/).
